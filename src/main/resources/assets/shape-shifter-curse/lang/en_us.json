Your small size makes you harder to hit with ranged attacks\nDue to enhanced familiar magic, you can brew strong splash potions of poison, healing and harming directly in your inventory by right-clicking water bottles on corresponding ingredients. You can now stack up to three identical potions.\nYour magical senses allow you to detect nearby creatures through walls\nYour thick fur protects you from sweet berry bushes\nFamiliar magic grants immunity to fire and lava damage. Most status effects no longer affect you, whether beneficial or harmful",

You must right-click while empty-handed to drain energy from neutral creatures to restore hunger\nAs a last resort, you can drain energy from hostile creatures - though their energy will weaken you...\nIntelligent creatures provide more nourishment. Besides, witches seem eager to supply their energy, you can store their energy in empty bottles for later use\nMaybe you should stay near them...\n\nYour health is reduced. Without proper hands for tools, your block-breaking speed is slower\nLeg armor no longer fits your quadrupedal form, and your swimming speed is reduced\nVillagers fear you and will actively avoid you",
